Revision history for Perl extension CGI::ExtDirect.

1.10  Mon Oct 17 00:21:42 2011
    - Fixed a (small) bug: extType parameter in form-based remoting
      calls was not caught and cleaned out before passing data hash
      to Method for execution.

      Removed CGI::Test notice from README; I am now maintainer of
      that module and CPAN distribution should be straightened
      already.

1.01  Tue Oct  4 21:35:06 2011
    - Bumped required RPC::ExtDirect version to 1.20.

1.00  Sat Oct  1 20:59:11 2011
	- original version.
