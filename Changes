2.03  Tue Jun 10 20:02:18 2014
    - Fixed a bug in CGI header handling that made HTTP response
      output to be mangled sometimes with Perls 5.18+

2.02  Thu Jun 21 10:27:33 2012
    - Fixed a bug in t/05_env.t

2.01  Wed Jun 20 18:37:54 2012
    - Minor documentation tweaks.

2.00  Mon Jun 18 14:15:11 2012
    - Updated code, documentation and test suite to accommodate
      for new features in RPC::ExtDirect 2.00.

1.12  Thu Jun  7 13:41:33 2012
    - Fixed a bug in handling uploaded files: CGI.pm below 3.41
      did not have "handle" method in its "lightweight file handle"
      objects, which CGI::ExtDirect relied on.
      Somehow this bug only manifested itself in Perl 5.10.0.

    - Fixed Makefile.PL to produce BUILD_REQUIRES only for 
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker that support it (>=6.55).

    - Bumped RPC::Dependency to freshly released 1.30.

1.11  Mon May 20 18:54:05 2012
    - Bumped CGI::Test dependency to version 0.3 which should not
      fail its tests anymore. Moved it to BUILD_REQUIRES section.

      Bumped RPC::ExtDirect dependency version to 1.21.

      Added repository and bugtracker attributes to Makefile.PL.

      Updated README a bit.

      No code changes this time.

1.10  Mon Oct 17 00:21:42 2011
    - Fixed a (small) bug: extType parameter in form-based remoting
      calls was not caught and cleaned out before passing data hash
      to Method for execution.

      Removed CGI::Test notice from README; I am now maintainer of
      that module and CPAN distribution should be straightened
      already.

1.01  Tue Oct  4 21:35:06 2011
    - Bumped required RPC::ExtDirect version to 1.20.

1.00  Sat Oct  1 20:59:11 2011
	- original version.
