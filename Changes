Revision history for Perl extension CGI::ExtDirect.

1.11  Mon May 20 18:54:05 2012
    - Bumped CGI::Test dependency to version 0.3 which should not
      fail its tests anymore. Moved it to BUILD_REQUIRES section.

      Bumped RPC::ExtDirect dependency version to 1.21.

      Added repository and bugtracker attributes to Makefile.PL.

      Updated README a bit.

      No code changes this time.

1.10  Mon Oct 17 00:21:42 2011
    - Fixed a (small) bug: extType parameter in form-based remoting
      calls was not caught and cleaned out before passing data hash
      to Method for execution.

      Removed CGI::Test notice from README; I am now maintainer of
      that module and CPAN distribution should be straightened
      already.
