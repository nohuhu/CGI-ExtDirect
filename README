CGI::ExtDirect
==============

    This module provides an RPC::ExtDirect gateway implementation for CGI
    compatible Web server environments. This includes both traditional CGI
    scripts that start up anew for each HTTP request, as well as more modern
    CGI environments in which a script is started once and then persists
    through the lifetime of a server process.

    CGI::ExtDirect can be used wth Perl versions 5.6 and newer with many Web
    servers; it was tested successfully with Apache/mod_perl, pure Perl
    server based on HTTP::Server::Simple (RPC::ExtDirect::Server), and
    various other HTTP server environments.

    If you are not familiar with Ext.Direct, more information can be found
    in RPC::ExtDirect::Intro.

INSTALLATION

    To install this module type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make test
        make install

EXAMPLES

    See included Ext JS examples for ideas on what Ext.Direct is and how to
    use it in CGI applications. The examples are not installed along with
    the CGI::ExtDirect module, and are only available in the `examples/'
    directory of the CPAN distribution.

    To run examples type the following in the CGI::ExtDirect tarball
    directory:

        cd examples
        perl p5httpd

    Note that these examples do not require CGI::ExtDirect to be installed
    so you can try them beforehand. That said, CGI::ExtDirect depends on
    RPC::ExtDirect being available in `@INC' so if you don't want to install
    either module, unpack RPC::ExtDirect and CGI::ExtDirect tarballs to the
    same directory and use `$PERL5LIB' to point to RPC::ExtDirect location:

        cd examples
        PERL5LIB=../../RPC-ExtDirect-3.xx/lib perl p5httpd
