CGI::ExtDirect
==============

This module implement RPC::ExtDirect gateway for CGI environment.
It was successfully tested with Perl 5.6 and newer in Apache CGI
and HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI applications. 

In fact, CGI::ExtDirect is dependent on only two non-core modules:
Attribute::Handlers and JSON, both of which support Perl 5.6 and
are pure Perl modules. Test suite is based on CGI::Test which is
only used for testing; it is not needed for normal operation and
in some cases may be skipped.

What this means is that now there is an easy way to provide older CGI
applications that are unfeasible (or plain impossible) to refactor
with simple and easy to use interface to one of the most advanced
JavaScript frameworks available.

RPC::ExtDirect is an implementation of Ext.Direct remoting protocol
used in Sencha Inc. ExtJS JavaScript framework.

For more information, see RPC::ExtDirect documentation.

For a simple example on how to use CGI::ExtDirect, see
example/ directory.
